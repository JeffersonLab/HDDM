\begin{abstract}
The HDDM (Hierarchical Document Data Model) is an xml schema for expressing
the meaning and relationships of streaming data from scientific instruments.
The design is based on a hierarchical network where each node in the graph
has a single parent node, multiple key-value attributes, and an arbitrary
number of child nodes, similar to a the elements in an xml document.
The model is adapted specifically to the case of repetitive data models
such as appear in the data stream from a high-energy physics experiment.
The representation of the model in xml is an essential feature, although
instantiation in memory does not involve the creation of explicit textual
elements or construction of a Document Object Model (DOM) for the data.
The HDDM toolkit includes tools to express HDDM streams in xml, check their
validity against the schema, and serialize/deserialize from container
objects in memory. Originally written in c, HDDM provides application
programmer interfaces for C++ and python as well. In addition to its own
native data format, applications that use HDDM to access their data can
also read/write standard HDF5 files and ROOT trees.

% body of paper here - Use proper section commands
% References should be done using the \cite, \ref, and \label commands

%% The normal text is displayed in two-column format, but special
%% sections spanning both columns can be inserted within the page
%% format so that long equations can be displayed. Use
%% sparingly.
%%\begin{widetext}
%% put long equation here
%%\end{widetext}
%
%% figures should be put into the text as floats.
%% Use the graphics or graphicx packages (distributed with LaTeX2e)
%% and the \includegraphics macro defined in those packages.
%% See the LaTeX Graphics Companion by Michel Goosens, Sebastian Rahtz,
%% and Frank Mittelbach for instance.
%%
%% Here is an example of the general form of a figure:
%% Fill in the caption in the braces of the \caption{} command. Put the label
%% that you will use with \ref{} command in the braces of the \label{} command.
%% Use the figure* environment if the figure should span across the
%% entire page. There is no need to do explicit centering.
%
%%\begin{turnpage}
%% Surround figure environment with turnpage environment for landscape
%% figure
%% \begin{turnpage}
%% \begin{figure}
%% \includegraphics{}%
%% \caption{\label{}}
%% \end{figure}
%% \end{turnpage}
%
%% tables should appear as floats within the text
%%
%% Here is an example of the general form of a table:
%% Fill in the caption in the braces of the \caption{} command. Put the label
%% that you will use with \ref{} command in the braces of the \label{} command.
%% Insert the column specifiers (l, r, c, d, etc.) in the empty braces of the
%% \begin{tabular}{} command.
%% The ruledtabular enviroment adds doubled rules to table and sets a
%% reasonable default table settings.
%% Use the table* environment to get a full-width table in two-column
%% Add \usepackage{longtable} and the longtable (or longtable*}
%% environment for nicely formatted long tables. Or use the the [H]
%% placement option to break a long table (with less control than 
%% in longtable).
